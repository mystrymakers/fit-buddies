<div className="fontsizeinc">A sport that is not super well known, but is gaining more and more fame, is powerlifting. It is a strength sport that focuses on performing three parts as hard as possible, namely squats, bench presses and deadlifts. Many a person who frequents the gym will perform these movements regularly, without knowing that these are part of powerlifting. In this article we explain what powerlifting is exactly, how you can participate in competitions in the Netherlands and what equipment you need to have if you want to perform it.

This blog about powerlifting was originally posted on November 1, 2020, but has been rewritten on March 4, 2023 due to several changes in the rules of (inter)national powerlifting.
</div><br></br>
<h2>What is Powerlifting?</h2>
In powerlifting, the goal is to lift as much weight as possible in one repetition of an element. You get three chances to perform each part in a match. You have one minute for this per attempt. So you only do nine repetitions in total; three squats, three bench presses and three deadlifts.

Per exercise, the highest lifted weight that is approved counts towards your total. The goal is therefore ultimately to achieve the highest possible total. If you enter a competition, you do so in classes based on gender and weight. So you want to achieve the highest possible total within your weight class, so that you can achieve a podium place or qualify for, for example, the National Championships, European Championships or perhaps even a World Cup. Your workouts will therefore be all about getting stronger and less focused on building muscle mass . After all, more muscle mass can make you heavier and have to participate in a higher weight class.

There are basically two major movements within powerlifting, namely classic (raw) and equipped. In the equipped variant, supporting suits are worn that contribute to how much weight someone can lift. In addition, knee wraps are also used when squatting. With the classic variant, these strengthening suits are not allowed and a singlet that offers no support must be worn. Knee wraps are also usually not allowed in classic powerlifting (knee sleeves are), although there are federations that allow this.

With both variants of powerlifting it is allowed to wear a belt, wristbands, deadlift socks and knee sleeves.

<h2>The three lifts of powerlifting
</h2>
As mentioned in the introduction, powerlifting consists of three exercises, namely squats, bench presses and deadlifts. This makes it a specialized form of strength training . Below we explain each exercise separately, with an emphasis on the requirements that would be imposed on it if you were to perform it in accordance with powerlifting rules at a competition. Do you want a general explanation of how to perform the exercise? Then click on the individual links per exercise for a detailed explanation of how to perform it.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Squat</h3>

The back squat, also known as knee bend, is the first exercise you will perform when you enter a powerlifting competition. The squat requires you to meet several requirements to ensure it is seen by the judges as a legitimate move.

When unpacking the bar, take a few steps back so that you have enough room for the movement. The knees must be straight, the back straight and the bar must be stationary. Then the jury gives the 'squat' signal and you can start to fall. A squat is deep enough when the fold of the hip is less than 90 degrees from the top of the knees. As soon as you are back at the top, the knees should be fully extended again. You then wait until the jury gives the 'rack' signal to put the rod back in the holder.

If you unexpectedly make a downward movement during the upward movement, but then simply squat the weight upwards, the turn will still be rejected. A downward movement is not allowed.

<h3></h3><h3>Bench press</h3>
In a powerlifting competition bench press, the aim is to place a weight dead still on the chest, after which you have to push it back up. The bench press also has a number of requirements that you must meet, so that it is seen as a good turn.

First of all, your buttocks and top of your back should touch the bench at all times. Your head should also not come off the bench after the starting signal has been given. The feet should be flat on the floor and should not come off the floor. After lifting, the arms should be fully extended and waiting for the signal from the jury. This calls 'start' and you can then lower the barbell to the chest.

As soon as the barbell hits the chest, hold it there until you get the 'press' signal. At that point, begin pushing until the barbell is back in the starting position with your arms fully extended. Again you have to wait for the signal from the jury. If the judge calls 'rack', the barbell may be returned to its holder.
<br></br>
<b>Update per 2023</b> : The international powerlifting federation (IPF) has introduced a new rule in the bench press, namely a minimum depth. Many athletes can do a high bridge with the lower back, shortening the bench press motion. To prevent this, at least one of the arms should bend at least 90 degrees at the elbows. This is also taken into account during judging and can ensure that a turn is rejected if you do not comply with this.

<h3></h3>
<h3>Deadlifts</h3>
The last part of powerlifting is the deadlift. Deadlifting involves lifting a barbell with weights off the floor until you are standing upright. There are also rules attached to this.

You do not have to wait for a start signal with the deadlift, but you can simply start the exercise when you are ready. As soon as you stand up straight, it is important that your knees are fully extended and your back is straight. The jury looks at your shoulders, because they should not hang forward, creating a kind of convex position of your upper back. As soon as you are upright, you have to wait for the 'down' signal. You may then lower the barbell, but must hold it until it reaches the floor.

The use of lifting straps is not allowed. So you have to hold the bar with your bare hand. The use of magnesium for extra grip is also allowed. Both the conventional and the sumo variant of the deadlift are allowed in powerlifting competitions.

<h2>(Competition) powerlifting in the Netherlands</h2>
To participate in powerlifting competitions in the Netherlands, you must become a member of a powerlifting association. The official federation in the Netherlands is the KNKF â€“ Powerlifting Section. The KNKF (Royal Dutch Power Sports and Fitness Association) is also affiliated with the EPF (European Powerlifting Federation) and IPF (International Powerlifting Federation). In addition, the union is also affiliated with the Doping Authority. Doping use in competitions is therefore not permitted and in some cases this is also checked.

Powerlifting competitions are regularly organized in the Netherlands. There are open competitions, in which everyone can participate, but also competitions especially for students. In addition, there are separate championships for sub-juniors, juniors and masters, in addition to the open Dutch championships of course. There is a qualification requirement for the open Dutch championships, because only the best powerlifters in the country are allowed to participate.

In addition to these official competitions where you must be a member of the KNKF, beginners competitions are also organized. You can participate in such a competition if you first want to taste whether powerlifting is something for you.

Would you like more information about participating in an official powerlifting competition or a beginners competition in the Netherlands? Or do you want more information about the competition calendar, results of competitions or registering with the KNKF? 

<h2></h2>
<h2>Weight classes
</h2>
<p className="para1">Different weight classes are used at the Dutch powerlift association. These classes are in line with the weight classes that are also used in the EPF and IPF. The weight per class is the maximum weight you can weigh when participating in a powerlifting competition. For example, are you participating in the 83 kg class for the men? Then your body weight must be a minimum of 74.01 kg and a maximum of 83.00 kg. Do you fall out of here on the day of the game? Then unfortunately you are not allowed to participate.
