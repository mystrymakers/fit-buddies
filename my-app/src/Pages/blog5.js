  <div className="fontsizeinc">We all know the feeling; don't feel like exercising. If this continues for a longer period of time, it can even have far-reaching consequences. For example, it can cause you to completely stop your physical activities for a long period of time. Of course you want to avoid that. When this happens and you really lose your motivation to exercise, it is important to regain this motivation. Do you recognize yourself in the above? Then read on quickly. In this blog we give 11 practical tips that can help you with that.

  <h2>Why have you lost the motivation to exercise?
</h2>
Before you even start with the tips below, it might be wise to first check with yourself why you have lost the motivation for sports. The reasons can be very different and you may not even know it right away. Nevertheless, it is an important aspect in rediscovering your motivation.

So first find out for yourself what caused the motivation to exercise to disappear. Then you can apply the tips from this blog and get off to a good start.

<h2>12 tips for motivation to exercise</h2>
Below you will find our 12 tips that can help you (again) find motivation to exercise. Almost all tips are relevant for everyone and are relatively easy to apply in your daily life. See for yourself which of the tips suit your situation and try it out!

<h2>Always keep your goal in sight</h2>
Setting a clear goal can mean a lot for your motivation to exercise. It may just be that you have lost sight of your goal. Time to take a step back and determine for yourself why you want to start or why you ever started. Make sure you write this down on a piece of paper and put it or hang it somewhere you can look at it regularly. You can also choose to have a photo printed on canvas . For example, you can incorporate an inspiring quote into your interior. This way you keep reminding yourself daily why you started exercising!

<h2>Make sure your goal is realistic</h2>
Goal setting is therefore an important motivational factor. It is also important to ensure that these goals are realistic. An unrealistic goal can cause your motivation to exercise to decrease, because you are unable to achieve these goals.

What can help is to set small realistic goals for yourself. Break your ultimate goal down into small goals that are all achievable. Not only does it become realistic to achieve these, you also keep it fun because you occasionally achieve goals.
<h2>Try motivational videos and music</h2>
Whether you do strength training or endurance sports, music can always have a rousing effect. By creating a playlist with your favorite inspirational songs you can give yourself a motivation boost to not only exercise, but also to push yourself to the limit during your training.

The same also works with videos. If you watch one or more motivational videos in advance, you will notice that you have an increased urge to exercise. Therefore, look for videos that match your goal and watch them before your workouts. In addition, it is also a good idea to surround yourself with motivational images, for example your idol printed as a photo on wood .


<h2>Find a training partner</h2>
Training together brings many benefits when it comes to motivation to exercise. First of all, many people just find it more fun to train together. You have someone to have a conversation with and to talk about the training itself. This makes it not only a physical activity, but also a social activity.

In addition, training with a training partner creates a kind of obligation. For example, you will feel guilty sooner if you cancel a training, because this also has an effect on your training partner. In this way too, training with someone can contribute to extra motivation.

<h2>Choose an appropriate schedule</h2>
It is important to perform exercises that match your goal. In addition, it is just as important that you enjoy performing these exercises. A schedule that fits in seamlessly with this will therefore positively contribute to your motivation with sports. Not only do you know that what you are doing is aimed at your goal as best as possible, you also enjoy doing it.

<h2>Plan days when you will train</h2>
By planning days in advance on which you will train, you will find that it becomes a kind of obligation. You have already promised yourself that you will train then and you have already taken it into account and planned nothing else. It would therefore be a great shame if you still decide not to go. So make sure you reserve fixed times during the week to exercise.

<h2>Take your sportswear with you in the morning</h2>
This may not sound so special, but taking your gym clothes with you in the morning can be a big motivation boost. Suppose you finish work at 4:30. You can go home, change and then start training. In addition, you can also go home, have dinner and then start training.

In both scenarios you first go home, which means you enter your own familiar environment. This can be demotivating, because you're finally home after a day's work. When you take your sportswear with you in the morning, you actually force yourself to go to the gym immediately after work. Then the reward is that you can have a quiet dinner at home and have the rest of the evening free.

<h2>Reward yourself occasionally</h2>
This tip ties in well with setting goals for yourself. The moment you reach a predetermined goal, you can choose to reward yourself for this. What kind of reward it should be, of course, differs enormously from person to person. Think, for example, of a day out or something delicious that you really like to eat.

By giving yourself these rewards, the motivation to exercise remains high and the effort remains fun to do.
Focus on your own progress
Many people lose their motivation in the progression of other people. “But she is progressing much faster” or “why can he and I can't yet?” are comments you often hear. Everyone is different and how someone progresses is very different. Therefore, do not focus on other people's progress, but only focus on your own. Keep your own goals in mind and don't get distracted by what other people are doing. After all, you will have to achieve your goals and not someone else's.

<h2>Measure your progress</h2>
Motivation in sports is often strongly dependent on the progress made. This progress is not immediately visible in all cases, but it is definitely there. Therefore, make sure you also measure this progression. Think of keeping track of how fast you can run that 5 km or how much weight you can bench press for 5 reps. There are many things that you can measure and therefore should measure.

For example, keep track of this in an application or just nice and old-fashioned in a handwritten training booklet. Everyone does it in their own way, but the most important thing is to actually do it.
Share your successes
If you have kept track of the progress you have made, it is also possible to share successes. This in many different ways. There's no right or wrong way to do this. This could be a social media post, telling family or friends, or any other possible way to share.

You often get positive reactions to your achieved goals. This in turn can provide extra motivation to do your best again in the following training sessions.

<h2>Have fun</h2>
The last and of course the most important tip: have fun exercising! If you like it, it's much easier to keep up. So try to choose a sport and exercises that not only match your goal, but that you also enjoy doing. This way you stay motivated to exercise at all times and you never lose sight of your goals!

<h2>Conclusion on motivation for sports</h2>
In the end you will really have to do it yourself and there is no one who can provide the motivation but yourself. Do you have any other useful tips that will ensure that you get motivation to exercise again? Leave a message under this blog. We are very curious what helps you to get motivation again.
