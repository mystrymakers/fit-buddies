  An afternoon nap can feel very pleasant. Just with your legs up on the couch or even in your bed. During the day you sometimes notice that your eyes (almost) close and then such a nap becomes very tempting. Of course this is not always possible, for example when you are at work, but even if it is possible, there is often a lot of doubt. After all, an afternoon nap isn't healthy, is it? Then you can't sleep at night anymore, can you? We researched it for you in this blog. Are you curious? Then be sure to read on.

  <h2>What is an afternoon nap?
</h2>
Perhaps a strange question to answer, but what exactly is an afternoon nap? If you dream away for a few minutes? Or do you really have to lie down for it extensively. We actually already speak of an afternoon nap when you consciously close your eyes and fall asleep as a result. This can be, for example, one hour or even more, but also as short as 10 minutes. We can therefore describe every moment that you take between noon to dream away as an afternoon nap.

<h2>What makes an afternoon nap healthy?</h2>
Now that we have an idea of ​​what is considered an afternoon nap, we can look at the effect it may have on our body. Below we cover the various consequences of an afternoon nap that are healthy. These advantages therefore ensure that taking an afternoon nap suddenly becomes even more attractive.

<h2>Improving memory</h2>
Taking an afternoon nap is associated with improved memory. A 30 minute nap works better for remembering new information than if you didn't take this nap and just continued studying. Of course there is a situation in which you feel the need to take an afternoon nap and in which you also continue studying after taking the nap.

<h2>Improving productivity</h2>
Do you sometimes notice that you are less productive at work in the afternoon? An afternoon nap can ensure that you are recharged and can look forward to a productive afternoon. Many large and international companies are also increasingly offering employees the opportunity to take a nap at work. They do this by setting up special rooms where employees can sleep. Maybe something to discuss during your next performance review?

<h2>May contribute to a healthy heart</h2>
Taking one or two afternoon naps a week was associated with a healthy heart in a more than 5-year study. The risk of cardiovascular disease among the test subjects decreased when they took one or two naps a week. This may also have to do with the stress-reducing effect of an afternoon nap.

<h2>What makes an afternoon nap unhealthy?</h2>
As always, it's not all roses and moonshine. There can also be disadvantages to an afternoon nap, which we may even see as unhealthy. Below you can read the disadvantages of an afternoon nap.

<h2>Drowsiness may develop</h2>
If your afternoon nap lasts just a little too long, there is a chance that you will not wake up energetically. The moment you end up in a deep phase of sleep and your alarm clock wakes you up, you will probably wake up feeling lethargic and sleepy. This has the opposite effect of what an afternoon nap should have, as it can actually make you less productive during the remainder of the afternoon.

<h2>Long afternoon naps can affect your night's sleep</h2>
When your afternoon nap gets too long, it can ultimately cause you to spend more time awake in your bed at night. That is of course not desirable, since you should have deep sleep at night, so that your body can really recover well. So make sure that if you take an afternoon nap, you don't do it for too long.

That leaves us with the question, of course, how long should an ideal afternoon nap last? You will find the answer in the next paragraph.

<h2>How long can an afternoon nap last?</h2>
Now that we know what the effects of afternoon naps can be, we can look at what the ideal afternoon nap looks like. First of all, we need to determine how long an afternoon nap can last. The ideal length of time that you can maintain is about 10 to 20 minutes. A nap of half an hour is also possible in some cases. It is best to experience for yourself to what extent you wake up refreshed, if your nap has already lasted 30 minutes.

Keep in mind that the longer the nap gets, the harder it will be to wake up feeling refreshed. You are more likely to fall into a deeper sleep, from which you will then be awakened. An afternoon nap longer than 60 minutes is even associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, compared to not taking an afternoon nap at all. This is shown by a meta-analysis in which the results of a total of 151,588 test persons were studied.

<h2>What is the ideal time to take an afternoon nap?</h2>
The ideal time for an afternoon nap naturally differs per person and what this person does during the day. For now use as an example someone who works a regular shift from 9 to 5. So this person probably has to get up quite early in the morning . In this case, early afternoon is the ideal time to plan your nap. If you do this before noon, chances are you're not tired enough to sleep yet. Do you do it later in the afternoon, for example after 3 o'clock? Then there is a chance that you will fall asleep less quickly in the evening.

So try to plan your nap in the early afternoon, for example at 1 o'clock. Of course, this depends on many factors whether this is possible. For example, do you work from home? Then you could occasionally use your break for a nice refreshing afternoon nap.

<h2>Tips for a successful afternoon nap</h2>
If you want to get the most out of your nap, there are a number of things worth considering. First of all, it works to move yourself to a cool and dark room. Next, it is advisable to make sure that the room you are in is as quiet as possible. Can't do this? Then you may be able to wear earplugs or put on background noise.

Put your phone on silent, so you don't suddenly wake up with a phone call or a message. A sleeping mask may also help, so that you are not awakened from your sleep by light that may shine into the room. It is also advisable to provide a nice pillow and a breathable duvet cover .

Is the weather nice? Then you can also choose to take your afternoon nap outside. That way you immediately grab some fresh air and your body produces some vitamin D, which also benefits your energy. For example, lie down on a lounger or relax in a hammock. Don't have trees or other attachment points for a hammock? Then you can use a hammock stand !

When you apply the above tips, you will notice that you become calmer and also fall asleep earlier. Your afternoon nap suddenly becomes a lot more pleasant. Now all you have to do is make sure that you actually get back to work after those 20 minutes.

<h2>So, is it good or bad?</h2>
We can therefore say that an afternoon nap, if done properly, can be healthy. You should make sure that you only sleep for about 10 to 20 minutes. Then you can continue with the afternoon refreshed, with good productivity and reduced stress levels. All in all, an afternoon nap every now and then is not a lazy trait at all, but simply good for your health! If anyone ever calls you lazy for taking a nap, just refer them to this article.
